# Soli's nvim config

## Introduction

This config was made basing itself off of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Philosophy
This config aims to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). There's no file splitting (readability is handled with extensive use of folds), because I personally prefer single-file configs. There's some quirky plugins which are far from being minimalist, but they're fun
